            India Gate is a war memorial located in New Delhi, the capital city of India. It was built to commemorate the sacrifice of Indian soldiers who died in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. India Gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of the most renowned architects of his time. He was also the architect behind many other famous buildings in New Delhi, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Parliament House, and the Connaught Place.

            The Taj Mahal changes color depending on the time of day. It appears to be pinkish in the morning, white in the afternoon, and golden in the moonlight.The construction of the Taj Mahal was so expensive that it bankrupted the Mughal Empire. It is said that over 1,000 elephants were used to transport materials to the building site.The Taj Mahal was almost destroyed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when British soldiers chiseled out precious stones and damaged the building's intricate marble carvings.

            The foundation stone of India Gate has a time capsule buried beneath it. It contains several important documents, including a copy of the Indian Constitution and the Gazette of India. The architecture of India Gate was inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and the Gateway of India in Mumbai. The design also incorporates elements of traditional Indian architecture, such as the lotus motif.

            The Amar Jawan Jyoti, the flame at the center of India Gate, was initially a temporary structure. It was later made permanent in honor of soldiers who died in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.India Gate was initially called the All India War Memorial. Its name was changed to India Gate after India gained independence in 1947.The walls of India Gate are inscribed with the names of soldiers who died in the World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. However, due to an oversight, the names of the Indian soldiers who died in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 are not included.
