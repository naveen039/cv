            The windows were designed to allow the women of the royal household to observe the street life and processions without being seen by the public, as they were required to observe "purdah" or the practice of seclusion.The palace is built in the form of a crown, with the windows resembling the crown's "jewels." It is said that the palace was built in this shape to honor Lord Krishna, who is often depicted wearing a peacock feather crown.

            The palace is also known as the Palace of Winds or the Wind Palace because of its unique architecture, which allows cool air to flow through the palace and keep it cool even in the hot summers of Rajasthan.The palace was designed by Lal Chand Ustad, a renowned architect of the time, and is made of red and pink sandstone. It has five floors, with a total of 953 small windows or "jharokhas," each of which is intricately carved and decorated.

The City Palace was the official residence of the Maharaja of Jaipur and is now a museum that showcases the rich history and culture of Rajasthan.Hawa Mahal has been featured in several films and TV shows, including the Bollywood films "Jodhaa Akbar" and "Bajirao Mastani."

            The palace has undergone several renovations and restorations over the years, with the latest one being completed in 2006.

            The palace was built in such a way that even during the hottest months of the year, the cool breeze from the nearby hills could pass through the palace, keeping it cool and pleasant.The palace was not only used by the women of the royal household to observe the street life, but it was also used by the male members of the royal family to watch the processions and other public events.The palace has a secret chamber called "Shri Niwas", which was used by the royal family to hold their private meetings and discussions.Hawa Mahal is one of the few buildings in India that does not have a foundation. Instead, it was built on a sloping terrain and is supported by two large pillars.

            The palace was originally designed to have a water system, which would have created a waterfall that cascaded down from the top of the palace. However, the system was never installed.The palace has a number of hidden passages and rooms, which were used by the royal family to move around the palace unnoticed.The palace was originally painted in bright colors, but over time, the colors faded away. In the 20th century, the palace was repainted in its original colors, which include shades of pink, yellow, and blue.
