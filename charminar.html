            Charminar is a historical monument located in the Old City area of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. It was built by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 to commemorate the end of a deadly epidemic that had ravaged the city. The monument is a four-pillared and arch-shaped structure, made of granite and limestone, and stands at a height of approximately 56 meters.

            The name Charminar comes from two Urdu words: "Char" meaning four and "minar" meaning tower. The monument has four minarets, each standing at a height of approximately 20 meters, and has a balcony on the second floor that offers a panoramic view of the city.

            There are several inscriptions on the walls of Charminar, but some of them are hidden from view. These inscriptions contain verses from the Quran and other religious texts, as well as details about the construction of the monument.If you stand at a certain point near Charminar and clap your hands, the sound echoes back to you in a unique way. This is because the stones used in the construction of the monument are said to vibrate at a particular frequency.

            There is a small museum inside Charminar that displays old photographs of Hyderabad from the time of its construction. These photographs offer a glimpse into the history and evolution of the city over the years.
