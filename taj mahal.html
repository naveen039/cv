            The Taj Mahal is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture and is located in Agra, India. It was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal and took over 20 years to complete.

            The building is constructed entirely of white marble and features intricate carvings and inlaid precious stones. The main structure is flanked by four minarets, each over 40 meters tall. The central dome of the Taj Mahal is also a major feature, rising to a height of 73 meters and adorned with a lotus design.

            The Taj Mahal is surrounded by beautiful gardens and a reflecting pool, which adds to its beauty and grandeur. The entire complex is considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.

            Visitors to the Taj Mahal are required to remove their shoes before entering the building and photography is prohibited inside the main mausoleum. The site attracts millions of visitors each year and is considered to be one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

            The Taj Mahal changes color depending on the time of day. It appears to be pinkish in the morning, white in the afternoon, and golden in the moonlight.The construction of the Taj Mahal was so expensive that it bankrupted the Mughal Empire. It is said that over 1,000 elephants were used to transport materials to the building site.The Taj Mahal was almost destroyed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when British soldiers chiseled out precious stones and damaged the building's intricate marble carvings.

            The four minarets of the Taj Mahal are slightly tilted outward to prevent them from falling on the main mausoleum in case of an earthquake.There is a secret passageway beneath the Taj Mahal that was used by the builders during construction. It is said to lead to the Yamuna River, which was used to transport building materials.

            It is believed that the architect of the Taj Mahal, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, had his hands amputated after the completion of the building so that he could never build anything as beautiful again.The Taj Mahal has a replica in Bangladesh called the Taj Mahal Bangladesh, which was built by a wealthy filmmaker in the 1980s as a tribute to his wife.
