            Golkonda, also spelled Golconda, is a historic citadel and fortress located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The name Golkonda is believed to have been derived from two Telugu words, "Golla" and "Konda," which mean "shepherd's hill." This is because the area around the fort was once inhabited by shepherds.

            The Golkonda Fort was originally built as a mud fort during the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty in the 12th century. It was later fortified by the Qutb Shahi dynasty in the 16th century.Golkonda was a prominent center of diamond trade in India during the medieval period.
